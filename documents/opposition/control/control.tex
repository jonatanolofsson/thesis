\section{Control}
\label{sec:control}
	The controller part of the thesis uses the models
	from the previous chapters to evaluate two methods for 
	Model Predictive Control, both of which are well justified, relevant 
	choices for the purpose of implementation on a microcontroller.

	Even though the MPC problem is well defined in the thesis, it would be 
	beneficial to describe and discuss its relation to the Linear Quadratic 
	controller, and to use this as a simple case to describe the weighting
	of error versus control signal amplitude.
	
	The optimization problem that the MPC solves is well described in the
	thesis, although without prior knowledge of the nature of PWM signals, 
	the reader may be severely confused as to why the rotational velocity
	of the propeller is limited to $[1000,2000]$ microseconds (wait, what?),
	and the angle of the servo to $[-300,300]$ microseconds - the latter 
	including negative time.
