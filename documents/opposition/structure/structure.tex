\section{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
	To the thesis, a table of notation is prepended. 
	Although the table may be somewhat inexhaustive, this is
	a very good idea and helps the uninitialized reader to understand the
	terminology.
	
	In the introduction, a good description of the thesis outline is provided
	as well as a description of the problem that was studied in the thesis.
	The section of related work could be expanded, however.

	The thesis is logically divided into the following parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Description of the tricopter,
		\item Motion model structure,
		\item Motion model identification,
		\item State estimation,
		\item Model Predictive Control.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The chapter outline is well chosen and logical, and there is an apparent
	thread throughout the thesis that is consitently followed on the path 
	to obtaining the controller which was to be studied in the project.
	
	The discussion of each chapter is placed at the end of each chapter,
	although the only chapter where this is apparent is the \textit{System Modeling}
	chapter, which is the only chapter with a section called \textit{Discussion}.
	In the other chapters, it is somewhat unclear where the theory ends and the
	discussion begins. The discussion might have been favorably collectively deferred to 
	a separate chapter following the presentation of the results.
