    \note{
        The work I present in this thesis covers the implementation and
        simulational evaluation of the algorithms presented here, as well
        as a lot of groundwork to connect these into a high-level control system
        for a UAV.

        I have extended the PTAM localisation library and incorporated
        its measurements into an extendable filtering framework to provide
        the state estimate needed to achieve the stable control nescessary for
        precision landing with a quadrotor.

        A controller for general nonlinear systems was proposed and integrated.
        Results are simulational, but with futher parameter tuning
        and enough computational power, they firmly suggest that full control
        and landing could be performed using this implementation.
