\note{
    Hello and welcome to my thesis presentation.
    My name is Jonatan Olofsson and have been working on this thesis for the
    past semester.

    I will begin this hour with a presentation of my work; taking about 20 minutes.
    Next, Karl-Johan Barsk will present the opposition and after that we will open
    up for questions.

\note{
    I will begin this presentation with an overview, including a description
    of the problem I have studied, as well as a short introduction to
    the techiniques I have studied. I will try to explain what problems I faced
    and the solutions I applied to make the technologies fit together.

    After having described the different parts of the thesis, I will
    present a few of the main technologies from the thesis in some more detail,
    namely the monocular SLAM, state estimation and nonlinear control.
    I will also try to clarify why the application of these techiniques were deemed
    nescessary to control the descent of the would-be-achieved landing procedure.
