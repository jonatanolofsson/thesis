    \note{
        For the video based SLAM part of this thesis, a library called PTAM was used.
        Again, the idea is to track features, here shown as dots, through
        the video frames to estimate the camera's position.
        One major problem with video based tracking is that, unless you know something
        about the recorded scene, there is no way of knowing wether its a large scene
        that moved a lot, or a small scene that just moved a little.
        As for instance when you film a doll house, there is simply no way
        to tell it from a real house, and yet the scale of movement is completely different.

        The scaling needs to be extracted from other sources, and autonomously so since
        the PTAM coordinate system is initialized quite arbitrarily.
        This coordinate system is of central importance, since all measurements
        are given relative to it, and yet both orientation, position and scale is initially unknown.

        PTAM tries to initialize its coordinate system on ground plane.

            \begin{array}{ll}
                \varnothing_{\text{PTAM}} &= \xi + R(q^{wb}) r_{\text{camera}/\mathcal{G}} + \lambda R(q^{wP}) \frac{X^{PTAM}}{|X^{PTAM}|} \\
                \varnothing_{\text{PTAM}} \cdot \hat{z} &= 0

    \subsection{Connecting the Coordinate Systems}
    \begin{frame}{Camera Measurements}
        To extract positioning measurements usable in the real world,
        the coordinate systems have to be related.
        \begin{align*}
            x^{\text{PTAM}} &= S(s) R(q^{Pw}) T(-\varnothing_{\text{PTAM}}) x^{\text{NEDEF}} \\
            q^{Pw} &= q^{PTAM,c} q^{cb} q^{bw}
        \end{align*}

    \subsection{Library Modifications}
    \begin{frame}{Library Modifications}
        In a deployment environment, the initialization and utilization of
        the camera sensor must be autonomous.

        In the thesis, several changes are implemented to the PTAM library, e.g.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Autonomous initialization procedure,
            \item Re-initialization,
            \item Origin positioning error detection,
            \item Remote interface for non-GUI use.
        \end{itemize}
