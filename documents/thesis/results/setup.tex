\section{Experiment Setup}
    The data used in this Chapter was recorded on the LinkQuad quadrotor in the Witas Vicon Lab
    at Link√∂ping University, Sweden. Ground truth data was recorded using
    the Vicon tracking system at a rate of $10~Hz$, while sensors were sampled
    at $500~Hz$ and logged on-board the LinkQuad.
    For the dataset used in this Chapter, where not noted otherwise,
    Camera data was collected at a rate of $30~Hz$ during 20-second bursts after
    which the data had to be written to memory.
    The camera was tilted approximately $30$ degrees downwards from the
    horizontal body-fixed plane of the quadrotor, giving an overview of the cluttered
    floor in Figure \ref{fig:results:setup:testarea}.
    The camera settings were tuned to minimize the disturbance from lightsources
    and the infrared light used by the Vicon system.
