\section{Model Verification}
\label{sec:results:modelling}
    The verification of a complex model is best done in small parts.
    It is however, with the model given in Chapter~\ref{cha:observer},
    difficult to evaluate each equation individually due to the couplings of the model.
    Instead, the verification is performed by evaluating a full test-flight
    with recorded data, using one dataset for calibrating sensor covariance
    and a second for validating the motion model.

    For each sensor the predicted and the measured values are compared,
    and the residuals - the difference between the two - are studied and
    fitted to a normal Probability Density Function, \textit{PDF}.

    \subsection{Accelerometers}
        \label{ssec:results:modelling:accelerometers}
        As most of the modeling in Chapter~\ref{cha:observer} concerns
        the forces acting upon the quadrotor, the accelerometers
        provide an interesting measure of the quality of the model.
        It should be noted that parameters were set to reasonable values,
        but no parameter tuning was performed on the motion model in the scope of this thesis.
        As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:accelerometers},
        the model leaves clearly trended residuals, not least in the
        horizontal directions where the model does very little.
        From the Figures~\ref{fig:results:modelling:accelerometersresiduals} and \ref{fig:results:modelling:accelerometersnormalfit},
        it can be seen that the model does have beneficial
        effects for the estimation, yielding predictions with lesser residuals
        than for instance a constant velocity model would.
        The residuals of Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:accelerometersresiduals}
        are centered around zero due to the compensation
        for sensor bias, which is relevant to reduce drift in the system,
        and exhibit a fairly good match to the normal PDF in Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:accelerometersnormalfit}.

    \subsection{Gyroscopes}
        \label{ssec:results:modelling:gyroscopes}
        It is clear, from Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:gyroscopes}, that
        the model describes the angular velocity of the quadrotor well.
        The residuals, presented by Figures~\ref{fig:results:modelling:gyroscopesresiduals}
        and \ref{fig:results:modelling:gyroscopesnormalfit}
        display a behavior which is adequately well described by a random,
        normally distributed, variable, which is expected from the
        standard Kalman filter framework.

    \subsection{Pressure Sensor}
        Pressure sensors are associated with a great amount of noise,
        as clearly seen in Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:pressure}.
        While the residuals, Figures~\ref{fig:results:modelling:pressureresiduals}
        and \ref{fig:results:modelling:pressurenormalfit}, does not exhibit
        any obvious trends, noise does spill into the positioning with
        the current tuning, currently adding little contribution
        to the state estimation. This may be improved by further filter tuning,
        although indoor use of pressure sensors is, like magnetometers, known to
        be problematic due to air conditioning and other sources of pressure changes.
        To remove the noise induced into the filter by the pressure sensor,
        it was removed from the final filtering evaluation.

        \fig{\plotwidth}{pressurenormalfit}{Pressure residuals fitted to a normal PDF. Both theoretical and numerical values have been normalized to a maximum height of one.}{fig:results:modelling:pressurenormalfit}

    \subsection{Camera Positioning}
        The camera tracking, shown in Figures~\ref{fig:results:modelling:camera}-\ref{fig:results:modelling:cameranormalfit},
        exhibit very good stability and performance, and significantly add to
        the filter performance. The absolute positioning provided by the
        camera counters the drift in derived observer states,
        and provides accurate measurements of orientation angles and position, as
        exhibited in Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:camera}.
        Because of potential errors in the world-to-PTAM transformation, the orientation - which
        is independent of the scale - is often the most reliable of the two measured quantities.
        It should be noted that the position results, especially in
        Figures~\ref{fig:results:modelling:cameraresiduals}-\ref{fig:results:modelling:cameranormalfit}
        should be scaled by a factor - for this data approximately $3$ - to correspond
        to metric quantities.

        When the PTAM library is initialized, it tries to determine the
        ground plane.
        It is thus possible to verify, in Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:camerainitframe},
        the initialization process and world-to-PTAM transformation
        by confirming that the $\hat{z}$-axes ($\hat{z}^{NEDEF}$ and $\hat{z}^{PTAM}$) are approximately parallel.
        The slight tilting observed in Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:camerainitframe}
        is caused by a misplacement of the ground plane in the initialization process,
        which is also visible in Figure~\ref{fig:video:ptamtracking}.
        Since the pose at the time of initialization is known, this tilting
        is compensated for in the calculated transformation, making the positioning
        less sensitive for PTAM initialization errors.
        Exact positioning on the moment of initialization is still of importance, however.

        In Figure~\ref{fig:results:modelling:camera}, a slight bias can be noted in the altitudinal positioning.
        This is due to the discrepancies between the PTAM library's ground plane position
        and the true ground plane.
