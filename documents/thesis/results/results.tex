\chapter{Results}
\label{cha:results}
    This chapter contains results evaluating the algorithms presented in the previous chapters.
    The model is verified against data collected on the LinkQuad, as well
    as ground truth from the Vicon motion tracking system available.
    Ground truth was used only for initializing the model, and all test
    were run off-line on recorded sensor data and video feed.
