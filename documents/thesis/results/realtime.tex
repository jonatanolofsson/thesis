\section{Real-time Performance}
\label{sec:results:realtime}
    The real-time performance was measured for the CRAP system using the
    recorded data to simulate flight on the gumstix.
    $611$ time-steps were performed, each with time update,
    IMU measurement update, camera measurement update and control signal update.
    The system was set to run at $30$ Hz, yielding a theoretical execution time of
    $\frac{611}{30} = 20.366\cdots $ seconds. The execution time was
    measured using the UNIX \texttt{time} command, which returns
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User time, the time used by the process directly,
        \item System time, the time spent by the kernel on behalf of the process,
        \item Total wall time spent by the process,
        \item Percentage of CPU time devoted to the executed process.
    \end{itemize}

    The results include the initial setup and configuration and was as follows:
    \begin{verbatim}
        17.78 user 3.67 system 0:21.50 elapsed 99\% CPU
    \end{verbatim}
