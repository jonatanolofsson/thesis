\chapter{CRAP}
\label{app:crap}
    For the implementation of the theory presented in this report, a
    framework was developed for connecting the different separable modules
    and provide a core library of useful functions.
    The result is called \textit{\C++ Robot Automation Platform}, or \crap for short.
    The main ideas of \crap are borrowed from the \textit{Robot Operating System}, \textit{ROS}\footnote{\url{http://ros.org/}},
    while implementing these in a much more efficient and uniform manner.
    By constraining the intermodular messaging to \C++\footnote{ROS allows messaging between Python and C++ modules} and compartmentalizing the
    modules in separate threads as opposed to processes, \crap significantly
    reduces the overhead associated with the flexibility of such modular software.
