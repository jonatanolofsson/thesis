\subsubsection{Wind}
    For describing the wind's impact on the quadrotor motion,
    a simple wind model is applied where the wind is modelled with
    a static velocity that imposes forces and moments on the quadrotor.
    The wind velocity vector is estimated by the UKF and may thus still vary
    in its estimation trough the measurement update.
    The wind velocities in the filter is given in the NED reference frame.

    The wind drag force is calculated using equation \eqref{eq:observer:wind:dragforce},
    whereas the moments are given by equations \eqref{eq:observer:wind:moments}.
    In this thesis, the moments acting on the quadrotor body (as opposed to the rotors)
    are neglected or described by moments imposed by the wind acting on the rotors.

    \begin{subequations}
        \begin{equation}
            F_{wind} = F_{wind,body} + \sum_{i=0}^{3} F_{wind,ri}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            F_{wind,body} = -\frac{1}{2} C_{D} \rho A V_{rel} ||V_{rel}||
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            F^{BF}_{wind,ri} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho C_{D,r} \sigma A_{r} (V_{ri} \cdot e_{P_{ri}3}^{BF}) ||V_{ri} \cdot e_{P_{ri}3}^{BF}|| e_{P_{ri}3}^{BF}
        \end{equation}
    \end{subequations}

    \begin{subequations}
        \begin{equation}
            M_{wind} = M_{wind,body} + \sum_{i=0}^{3}M_{wind,ri}
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            M_{wind,body} \approx 0 % Could perhaps be better approximated by constant*\sum_{i=0}^{3}M_{wind,ri}, for small constant, modelling the wind's effect on the four arms
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
            M_{wind,ri} = D_{ri}^{BF} \times F^{BF}_{wind,ri}
        \end{equation}
    \end{subequations}
