\chapter{State Estimation}
\label{cha:observer}
    A central part of automatic control is to know the state of the device you are
    controlling. The system studied in this thesis - the LinkQuad - is in constant
    motion, so determining the up-to-date position is of vital importance.
    This chapter deals with the estimation of the states relevant for positioning
    and controlling the LinkQuad.
    Filter theory and notation is established in Section \ref{sec:observer:filtering}.

    In this thesis, an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) both are evaluated.
    These filters both extends the linear Kalman filter theory to the non-linear case.
    The UKF circumvents the linearization used in the EKF in an appealing black-box way,
    albeit it is more sensitive to obscure cases in the physical model,
    as detailed in the discussion in Chapter \ref{cha:discussion}.
    The theory of the EKF and UKF is treated in
    Section \ref{sec:observer:filtering} and \ref{sec:observer:ukf} respectively.

    The motion model of the system is derived and discussed in Section \ref{sec:observer:motionmodel}.

    As well as beeing modelled, the motions of the system are captured by the on-board sensors.
    A measurement $y$ is related to the motion model by the sensor model $h$;
    \begin{equation}
        y(t) = h(x(t),u(t),t)
    \end{equation}
    The models for the sensors used in this work are discussed in Section \ref{sec:observer:sensormodels}.
