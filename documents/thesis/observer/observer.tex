\chapter{State Estimation}
\label{cha:observer}
    A central part of automatic control is to know the state of the device you are
    controlling. The system studied in this thesis - the LinkQuad - is in constant
    motion, so determining the up-to-date position if of vital importance to the performance
    of the control.
    This chapter deals with the estimation of the states relevant for positioning
    and controlling the LinkQuad.
    Filter theory and notation is established in Section \ref{sec:observer:filtering}.

    In this thesis, an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used, which extends the
    linear Kalman filter theory to a non-linear model in an appealing black-box way.
    The theory of the UKF is treated in Section \ref{sec:observer:ukf}.

    The motion model of the system is derived and discussed in Section \ref{sec:observer:motionmodel}.

    The motions of the system is also captured by the on-board sensors.
    A measurement $z$ is related to the motion model by the sensor model $h$;
    \begin{equation}
        z(t) = h(x(t),u(t),t)
    \end{equation}
    The models for the sensors used on the LinkQuad are discussed in
    Section \ref{sec:observer:sensormodels}.
