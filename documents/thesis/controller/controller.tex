\chapter{Non-linear Control}
\label{cha:controller}
    To control a quadrotor's movements, a non-linear controller is applied to the
    physical system, using a model of the system to calculate the best
    (in a sense well defined in this chapter) signals of control to each
    of the engines driving the propellers.

    The controller approach chosen in this thesis is based on the Linear Quadratic (LQ)
    controller, the theory of which is presented in Section \ref{sec:controller:lq}.
    An extension to the technique of \textit{gain-scheduling} is discussed
    in Section \ref{sec:controller:gainscheduling}.

    The physical model of the system was derived in Section \ref{sec:observer:motionmodel}.
    In Section \ref{sec:controller:model}, this is further developed
    and adapted for compatibility as a model for the controller.
