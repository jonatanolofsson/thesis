\chapter{Nonlinear Control}
\label{cha:controller}
    The state estimate from the algorithms discussed in Chapter~\ref{cha:observer}
    can be used to control the quadrotor's movements according to a desired
    reference.

    In this thesis, a nonlinear controller is proposed to be applied to
    control the movements of the physical system, using a model
    of the system to calculate the signals of control to each
    of the motors driving the propellers.

    The controller approach proposed in this thesis is extended from the Linear Quadratic (LQ)
    controller, the theory of which is presented in Section~\ref{sec:controller:lq}.
    The extension, related to the technique of \textit{gain scheduling}, is discussed
    in Section~\ref{sec:controller:gainscheduling}.

    The physical model of the system was derived in Section~\ref{sec:observer:motionmodel}.
    In Section~\ref{sec:controller:model}, this is further developed
    and adapted for compatibility as a model for the controller.
    The controller is interfaced by providing references
    for the NED-frame velocities and the, body-fixed, yaw rate.
    The controller outputs reference angular rates for each propeller.
