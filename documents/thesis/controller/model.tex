\section{Control Model}
\label{sec:controller:model}
    In Chapter \ref{cha:observer}, a physical model of the system
    was derived. To incorporate the information from the physical model
    into the governing control law, the model needs to be fitted into
    \eqref{eq:controller:affinelq} by providing analytical\footnote{Analytical results are not strictly needed but are, in this case, easily obtained.}
    expressions for the Jacobi matrices with regards to $x$ and $y$,
    and removing states which will not be used in the controller.

    \textbf{The model in Chapter \ref{cha:observer} should be validated before
    proceeding with this section.}
