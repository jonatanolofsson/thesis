\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	This document contains the post-project reflections of the Master's Thesis
	\textit{Towards Autonomous Landing of a Quadrotor using Monocular SLAM Techniques}
	performed during the spring semester of 2012 by Jonatan Olofsson.
	The thesis was performed as a final project in the education of
	\textit{Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering} at Link√∂ping University, the Y-program.

	The goal of the thesis was to develop a control system for the LinkQuad quadrotor
	capable of incorporating video SLAM position measurements to stabily land the vehicle.
	While the algorithms failed to run real-time to enable flight, the
	implementation was verified in simulation with promising results,
	and the theoretic contributions included for instance advanced physical modeling and
	work on a general nonlinear controller.
