	The thesis covered development and implementation of nonlinear
	state estimation and nonlinear control of a quadrotor.
	These fields are well covered by the education, in courses such as Control Theory [TSRT09]
	and Sensor Fusion [TSRT14], both given at ISY. 
	The way of thinking in modular systems that is taught in the control-related
	courses at ISY was put to good use.

	One course that was unexpectedly contributive to the thesis was the 
	Computer Graphics course [TSBK07], due to the practical experience of treating
	arbitrary chained transformations of coordinate systems. 
	
	The Computer Graphics course was also helpful to understand the implementation
	and limitations of the libraries of Visual SLAM that were studied.

	To be able to compile and get the vSLAM libraries - which are often experimental 
	at best - running, I had great use of my programming experience, developed mainly
	from projects outside the University. 

	This thesis binds together, and extends, most all of the courses of the Y-program's
	profile for automatic control. The thesis couples physical, mechanical 
	modeling with its implementation into filtering and control algorithms.
	The implementation was also made to run very close to the hardware that is
	studied in some of the computer courses of the Y-program.
